    <h1>Plot Overview<hr></h1>
    <p>2024's Damsel directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo features Millie Bobby Brown as Elodie trapped in a dark fantasy world.<br> In this intriguing tale,
        "Millie Bobby Brown, known for her role in <b>“Stranger Things”</b>", defies the traditional damsel-in-distress trope.<br>
        Heres a summary of the film:<br>
        <b>Setting the Stage:</b>
        The story begins with a glimpse of the past, where a king and his army venture into a mountain cave in search of treasure.<br>
        However, they encounter a fire-breathing dragon, resulting in the soldiers demise. Only the king survives, fate unknown.<br>
        <b>Present Day:</b>
        Several centuries later, we find an impoverished kingdom struggling to survive due to resource scarcity.<br>
        The ruler, King Bayford(played by <b><i>Ray Winstone</i></b>), faces challenges in providing for his subjects.<br>
        Princess Elodie(played by <b><i>Millie Bobby</i></b>) and her sister Floria(played by <b><i>Brooke Carter</i></b>) lead humble lives,<br>
        sharing chores and gathering resources like everyone else.<br> 
        <b>The Unexpected Proposal:</b>
        A fancy carriage arrives, surprising everyone. It carries a marriage proposal for Elodie from the distant kingdom<br>
        of Aurea. Prince Henry(played by <b><i>Nick Robinson</i></b>), Elodies prospective husband, possesses vast wealth and a fleet of ships.<br>
        Despite Elodies desire to explore the world independently, she agrees to the marriage for the sake of her people.<br>
        <b>The Twist:</b>
        Elodie discovers that her marriage was a trap. The royal family intends to sacrifice her to repay an ancient debt.<br>
        She finds herself in a cave with a fire-breathing dragon, relying solely on her wits and determination to survive.<br>
        <b>No Knight in Shining Armor:</b>
        Unlike traditional fairy tales, there is no knight waiting to rescue Elodie.<br>
        She must navigate danger, uncover lies, and forge her own path to safety.<br>
        While “Damsel” doesnt break new ground, its visual effects and overall plot make for an enjoyable watch.<br> 
        Elodies journey from princess to survivor is both captivating and empowering.

      <h3>Release</h3>
      <p>Damsel was scheduled to stream on <b><i>Netflix</i></b> on <i>October 13, 2023</i>.<br>

        the original release date was postponed and the film began streaming on <i>March 8, 2024</i>.<br><br>
      
        <b>Novel</b><br><br>

        Author <b><i>Evelyn Skye</i></b> released a novelization of the film in advance. She stated:<br>   
        "The easiest way to think about it is this: <i>Dan Mazeau</i> wrote the original screenplay.<br> 
        I was able to read an early draft and was given free rein to write my own version of the story, which ultimately became the novel.<br> 
        Both the novel and the movie may stem from the same origin, but they are also each their own unique works of art".
