        <h1>Plot</h1>
        <p>The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm.<br> 
        All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the dragon's mercy.<br><br>

        Centuries later, Elodie, daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry Prince Henry.<br> 
        On Bayford's advice, Elodie accepts to help their impoverished people, and she and her family sail to Aurea.<br>
        Upon meeting, Elodie and Henry initially both seem disinterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel.<br> 
        Elodies stepmother, Lady Bayford, seeks out the queen, hoping to strengthen their familial bond, but Isabelle rebuffs attempts to become acquainted,<br> 
        leading Lady Bayford to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement.<br><br>

        After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union.<br> 
        The queen, dressed as a priestess, describes the pact between the first king and the dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters for peace<br>. 
        Following a ceremony where their hands are cut and held together, Henry insists on carrying Elodie across the narrow path over the dragon's lair, then throws her into the chasm.<br><br>
        
        After recovering from the fall knowing that she is the actual sacrifice, Elodie looks for a way out.<br> 
        The dragon enters the lair, asks her name and taunts her before chasing Elodie and burning her leg.<br> 
        After escaping the beast, Elodie discovers an illuminated cave with glowing slugs, which she collects as a light source.<br><br> 
        The dragon finds her again.

        Upon fleeing, Elodie reaches a chamber with the note "Safe Here She Cannot Reach", the names of past victims and a map carved into the wall.<br> 
        While Elodie sleeps, the glowing slugs heal the burn on her leg.<br>
        Elodie follows the map, but it leads to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside.<br> 
        She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, providing the reason for the royal sacrifices.<br>
        A rescue party led by Lord Bayford is almost immediately dead on arrival, but the distraction allows Elodie to climb a rope to escape the mountain.<br> 
        She then takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit.<br><br>

        The conflagration alerts Isabelle that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, forcing her to kidnap Elodie's sister Floria as a replacement.<br> 
        After her stepmother rides out and informs her, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria.<br> 
        The dragon leaves Floria alive as bait for Elodie. Elodie creates a diversion to distract the dragon so she can reach Floria.<br><br> 
       
        
        Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the dragon and tries to convince her that they've both been deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding,<br>  
        the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals were mingled, thereby deceiving the dragon that the sacrificed princesses were Aurean royalty.<br> 
        The dragon refuses to believe Elodie, stating that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself.<br> 
        With the dragon at her mercy, she heals both of them with the glowing slugs. Elodie and the dragon then interrupt another wedding at the palace, exposing the Aureans' treachery.<br> 
        Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home,<br> 
        loaded with supplies and accompanied by the dragon.
